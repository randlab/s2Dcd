README
==============

This is the README file of the `s2Dcd`, a Python package that allows
to obtain 3D multiple-point statistics (MPS) simulations by using only 2D training images (TIs).

Quick start
*****************

**NOTE:** To run the `s2Dcd`, a MPS simulation engine like the `DeeSse
<http://www.randlab.org/research/deesse/>`_ is needed!

Clone or download the `s2Dcd` package on a local directory.
Then inside the dowloaded directory::

  pip install -e .
