README
==============

This is the README file of the `s2Dcd`, a Python package that allows
to obtain 3D multiple-point statistics (MPS) simulations by using only
2D training images (TIs).  More detais about the methodology can be
found in the paper by *Comunian, Renard and Straubhaar*, DOI:
`10.1016/j.cageo.2011.07.009
<http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.cageo.2011.07.009>`_.

Quick start
*****************

**NOTE:** To run the `s2Dcd`, a MPS simulation engine like the `DeeSse
<http://www.randlab.org/research/deesse/>`_ is needed!

Clone or download the `s2Dcd` package on a local directory.
Then inside the dowloaded directory::

  pip install -e .
