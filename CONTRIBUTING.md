# Contributing to `s2Dcd`

You can contribute to the development of the `s2Dcd` in many
ways. Hereinafter we list the main contribution possibilities, but
feel free to contact the maintainers to ask more details.

In the next section are listed some possible contribution
options. Please also have a look at the [TODO](TODO.md) for more ideas
about possible contributions.

## Contribute with a case study

If you are using the `s2Dcd` to one case study that introduces some
novelty with respect to the examples already available on this site, please let us now so that we can upload it in the examples section.

## Use of other algorithms

Although the current version of the `s2Dcd` heavily relies on the
`DeeSse` multiple-point statistics simulation engine, the working
principle `s2Dcd` could be extended to other multiple-point statistics (MPS)
simulation engines. Again, with some modifications the code could be
made even more *general purpose* to include other geostatistical
simulation algorithms (obviously, provided that can incorporate
conditioning data).

In fact, one of the very first version of the `s2Dcd` was designed to
work with different MPS simulations engine, like for example engines
based on lists (like *IMPALA*) and the Direct Sampling (like the
*DeeSse*).

## Bug finding

Please notify us if you find something going wrong with the code or
some bug.
